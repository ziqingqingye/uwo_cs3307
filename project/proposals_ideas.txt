GROUP Project Discussion: 

Do not have to use Raspberry Pi platform...

REQUIRED FEATURES:
- collision of the snake with objects
- movement of the snake (Up, Left, Down, Right)
- making the snake longer
- snake food should be randomly generated (random x/y coordinates)
- scoreboard [displays your current score and compares it to previous scores]

OPTIONAL FEATURES: 
- the hand gestures/hand movement as controller for the snake
- adding background music to the game

Wish-List Feature: 
- multiplayer, 
- bluetooth connectivity, 
- controlling the snake via brain waves, 
- add colour to the game




RISKS: 
- no major for the snake game
- OpenCV capturing the camera/hand gestures [we may be able to track the movements
  but mapping them to the controls will be difficult]
- there may be delay between the hand movement and the actual movement of the snake
- determining the collision of the snake and obstacles of various sizes may be difficult
  to implement. 
- if we code the game solely using C++. the image of the snake my not keep up with the 
  movement / image rendering may be choppy
- OpenCV may not work
